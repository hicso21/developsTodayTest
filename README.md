## Back-end

### To start:
### In the root folder, add the .env file where the base urls and the port will be included
### Then use the npm install or yarn command to install the dependencies.
### Then we can start the server using npm run start or yarn run start.

## Front-end

### Position in the root file in the console
### Execute the command npm install or yarn
### Run npm run dev or yarn run dev

## Comments

### Don't forget to build the backend before using the front end in order to make use of the api, otherwise you won't be able to use the web.
